<p><span id="more"><span id="dots">...</span>In Pakistan, 40% of all diseases are linked to kidneys, bladder and urinary tract or the liver.  One out of every eight Pakistani, during his or her lifetime, will suffer from these life-threatening ailments. The pain of losing a loved one is unbearable enough, but losing a loved one knowing that he or she could have been saved, is a feeling that none of us can imagine, unless we experience it. Such appalling and nerve-wrecking situations happen on a regular basis in Pakistan and on an unacceptable scale.  The underprivileged suffer the most, due to lack of financial support. Our mission at Pakistan Kidney & Liver Institute and Research Center (PKLI & RC) is to alleviate this suffering and provide the best possible treatment to all without any consideration of financial ability. <br>  

Irrespective of financial status or background, PKLI & RC is a place where the only priority is to save a life. It aims to provide treatment to whoever needs it in a state-of-the-art hospital with world class facilities. A simple and elegant design with gardens and waterfalls, the PKLI hospital will provide a soothing environment for the treatment of Kidney and Liver diseases, including transplantation. The centre will also impart training to specialist doctors, nurses and paramedics in this field. <br>

PKLI, after its completion in 2017, will be one of the bigger transplant centers in the world. It will not only provide free of cost medical services to the poor, but will also provide employment to some 5000 persons, including training for doctors, nurses and paramedics. This highly trained human resource will not only benefit the health care industry locally, but will also be a much sought after resource outside the country.<br>

The construction of the hospital is divided into three phases with first 100 beds to be inaugurated in December 2017. PKLI will eventually be a facility with 800 beds (extendable to 1500 beds), a100 bed emergency centre, a 100 bed ICU, a 100 beds outpatient dialysis facility, 500-bed in-patient facility, 20 operating rooms & 10 same day surgery suites. PKLI is situated on a 60-acre plot in the Lahore Knowledge City in between DHA phase 6 and Bedian Road. <br>

PKLI is managed by an independent Board of Trustees, which has representation from the Government and the Private Sector.<br>

With the support and encouragement of the Chief Minister, Government of the Punjab, Mian Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, Prof. Saeed Akhter is turning his dream of providing exceptional healthcare facilities to everyone, into a reality.  A Public-Private Partnership, this visionary project is not the preserve of a few individuals, it is YOUR project - A project of the people of Pakistan. This initiative will not see the light of day, if it does not have the support and ownership of all of us. <br>

Prof. Saeed Akhter spent the early part of his career in the U.S and is currently the Head of Urology and Transplantation at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. In 2004, he set up the Pakistan Kidney Institute with the support of Shifa International, which treats patients free of cost and has treated 120,000 patients till now. He was very keen to expand this activity and set up a full-fledged hospital and this dream came true, when Mr. Shahbaz Sharif, Chief Minister of Punjab, agreed to fund this initiative on a Public-Private partnership model.  <br>

This led to the creation of Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute & Research Center (PKLI & RC). </span></p>

  <br>
  While working as Chairman, Department of Urology at Texas Tech University, Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas, USA, Prof. Dr. Saeed Akhter decided to come back to Pakistan, with a zeal and mission to serve his country and improve the overall health care standards. Working in the real world, entrenched with poverty, misery, pain and social injustice, the real problems of Pakistan started emerging infront of him, and the realization that disease and sickness is a great test for anyone, but when this test combines with poverty and inability to pay for the treatment, it becomes absolutely unbearable. As he joined Shifa International Hospital (SIH) in 2000 he and his team started a state of the art urology and transplant program, which is now considered one of the best programs in the country. A team of competent well-trained doctors carry out wide spectrum of procedures daily including pediatric (children) and adult kidney transplant, complex cancer surgeries, reconstruction surgeries, comprehensive stone management program, female urology and pediatric urology surgeries at par with any developed nation following international standards.
  <br>
  <b style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 40px;">Pakistan Kidney Institute</b><br>
  Pakistan Kidney Institute (PKI), a center of excellence in urology, nephrology and kidney transplant was laid at Shifa International Hospital. The vision of PKI is to create an institute of urology, nephrology, and transplantation following the highest international standards of ethical and professional practices and a state of the art clinical care using the most modern technologies to poor at par with rich people of Pakistan irrespective of race, religion and the color. Since its inception, PKI has and continues to work for the prevention of kidney failure, urological cancers and stones by education and early intervention. State of the art education and training using structured training program at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels for doctors and school of nursing and paramedics is one of the trademark of PKI. Since its establishment, PKI has made a difference in the following areas:
  <br>
  <br>
  • Human Organ Transplantation Act<br>
  <br>
  • Awareness Programs<br>
  <br>
  • Management and Treatment<br>
  <br>
  • Education<br>
  <br>
  • Public Service<br>
  <br>
  • Research<br>
  <br>
  <b style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 40px;">Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute</b><br>
  PKI, at Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad has been serving poor patients from Punjab, KPK, Azad Kashmir, FATA, Baluchistan and Afghanistan for last eleven years. The work of PKI has been ever increasing and need for establishing a bigger independent institute that could treat larger population and also address the liver diseases was felt to be badly needed. PKI wanted to launch a state of the art center of excellence in urology, nephrology, liver diseases and the transplantation under the name of Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute and Research Center (PKLI & RC). A meeting was held with honorable Chief Minister of Punjab, Mian Shehbaz Sharif, who very kindly agreed with the concept and agreed to provide 60 acres of land and the seed money for PKLI & RC. </span></p>

<p><span id="more3"><span id="dots3"></span><br>
  It is with utmost humility and with great pleasure that I share with you the announcement of launching of Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute and Research Center (Trust), a center of excellence in urology, nephrology, hepatology  and transplantation, as an independent not for profit, charity institute in Pakistan. Fifteen years ago, while I was serving as chairman, Department of Urology at Texas Tech University, Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas, USA, I decided to move back to Pakistan to serve the homeland.  Here I saw the real problems of Pakistan; a country riddled with utmost poverty, poor governance and ignored health care systems. The fact that disturbed me the most was the deadly combination of disease and poverty. The turning of a curable disease into an incurable one, just because of lack of resources was unbearable.
  <br>
 
  Therefore, along with Dr Nayer Mahmud, I laid the foundation of Pakistan Kidney Institute in 2004 in the premises of Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad to deliver state of the art care in the field of urology and nephrology to underprivileged and poor patients either totally free or at minimum possible cost.
  <br>
  Excellence in undergraduate and post graduate medical education, cutting edge research and prevention of diseases were the other missions of PKI. By the grace of Allah, we have treated more than 83000 deserving patients since 2004 , have established one of the best residency programs in urology and nephrology  on the US model, have actively participated in relief and rescue in national and international disasters and arranged seminars and lectures to create awareness regarding prevention of diseases.
  <br>
   
  But this was not enough. The ever increasing burden of kidney and bladder diseases, with liver diseases taking the form of an epidemic, the need to build a state of the art center of excellence for treatment of liver and kidney diseases, specifically for poor patients, was strongly felt. To turn this dream into a reality, we contacted various people and by the grace of God when the proposal was presented to the CM Punjab, Mr. Shehbaz Sharif, he listened to us very attentively, understood the spirit of the mission, offered very enthusiastic support and followed through on every promise.
  <br>
  PKLI is no more a dream. It has turned into a reality. PKLI is an exceptional project which will provide free of cost, state of the art treatment of liver and kidney diseases including transplantation, will impart the  best training to produce future specialist doctors, nurses and paramedics  in this field, will do cutting edge research in our specialties and will work to create awareness regarding prevention of kidney, bladder and liver diseases.
  <br>
  PKLI will operate under its totally independent board on highest moral and professional grounds. Its physical infrastructure is designed by international medical designers following the most modern hospital design principles carrying the latest and most modern equipment. It will be the most beautiful but simple and elegant hospital surrounded by gardens and waterfalls. Its human resource will consist of local and international experts, especially expatriates Pakistani doctors practicing in the USA and UK.  Its sole purpose is to serve the people of Pakistan. We will serve without the discrimination of race, color, religion, cast, social and financial status. This is our institute. This is your institute. This is every Pakistani’s institute. Please own this project and become a part of it. Your ownership will help us excel and grow. May Allah SWT give us the strength and help us in our endeavors to help those, who are sick and can’t take care of themselves.</span></p>
